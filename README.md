Wherein I go way overboard in reverse-engineering & modding some old Nippon Ichi games.

See the pb_mods.py script for a bunch of QOL mods for Phantom Brave. Makai Kingdom ones forthcoming.


This project could not be possible without:

- [xdanieldzd's Scarlet project](https://github.com/xdanieldzd/Scarlet), which helped me work out some of Phantom Brave's archive formats.
- [ChepChep's notes on the English port of Makai Kingdom Portable](https://gbatemp.net/threads/phantom-kingdom-portable-english-translation.365313), which was similarly helpful for that game.
